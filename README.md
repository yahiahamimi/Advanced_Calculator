# Advanced Calculator (multiple operators)
This is a simple calculator project using Keypad and LCD with AVR microcontroller.

## Overview
This project is a simple calculator that can perform the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and can also perform calculations with multiple numbers and operators which is a great advantage. 
The calculator displays the result of the calculation on the LCD screen.

## Hardware Requirements
- AVR Microcontroller
- Keypad
- LCD screen

## Software Requirements
- AVR Studio or any other IDE for AVR microcontrollers
- C programming language

## How it works
The project consists of the following components:

* Keypad: used to input the numbers and operators.
* Microcontroller: used to process the input and calculate the result.
* LCD Screen: used to display the result.

The project workflow is as follows:

1. The user inputs the numbers and operators using the keypad.
2. The microcontroller processes the input and calculates the result.
3. The result is then displayed on the LCD screen.
4. The user can then input another number or operator to calculate another result.


The project is implemented using the C programming language and the AVR microcontroller. The project uses the following libraries:

* Keypad library: used to read the input from the keypad.
* LCD library: used to display the result on the LCD screen.
* Standard library: used for the calculation and other functions.

The project is divided into the following components:

* Main program: contains the main loop of the program.
* Keypad program: contains the functions to read the input from the keypad.
* LCD program: contains the functions to display the result on the LCD screen.
* Calculation program: contains the functions to calculate the result.

The project is designed to be easy to use and understand. The user can input numbers and operators using the keypad and the result is displayed on the LCD screen. The project is also designed to be expandable, so that more complex calculations can be added in the future.
